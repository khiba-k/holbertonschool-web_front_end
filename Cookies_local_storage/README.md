# Holberton School - Web Frontend

## Cookies and Local Storage Project

This project focuses on using **Cookies** and **Local Storage** to manage and persist data in a web application.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and Webpack Dev Server

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khiba-k/holbertonschool-web_front_end.git
   cd cookies-localstorage-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Webpack Dev Server and Accessing the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
```

This will start a local development server and automatically rebuild your code on changes.

Once the server is running, open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:8080/0-index.html
```

Replace `0-index.html` with the appropriate file name if needed.

## Features
- Store and retrieve data using **Cookies** and **Local Storage**.
- Demonstrates client-side data persistence.
- Uses **Webpack** for module bundling.
